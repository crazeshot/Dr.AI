# Dr.REM

Dr.REM (Real Time eHealth Mapping) is a prototype pre-diagnosis app built as a demo model to show how technology can assist in healthcare. It is developed using Python (Flask framework) for the backend, a pre-trained model stored in a .pkl file for disease prediction, and NumPy for vector processing of symptom data. The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple yet interactive interface where users can enter up to seven symptoms. When submitted, the backend processes the inputs, matches them with the trained dataset, and predicts the most likely disease with about 70% accuracy. The project has been deployed on Render, a cloud platform that provides free hosting for web apps, and UptimeRobot has been integrated to send pings to the hosted app to keep it alive, ensuring that the service doesn’t go down due to Render’s inactivity timeout. This project is not a full-scale AI application, but a base model meant to prove how such systems can be built. In the future, this concept could be scaled into a powerful app powered by large AI models and vast medical datasets, capable of identifying diseases instantly, even in offline mode, and enhanced further by offering first aid tips and remedies to provide immediate help before consulting a doctor. With the wide availability of smartphones, this app could be made accessible to everyone, creating a global healthcare tool that is both fast and affordable.

The main purpose of Dr.REM is to address real-world problems in healthcare such as limited access to doctors in rural areas, high consultation costs, hospital overload, travel expenses, and delays in diagnosis, all of which affect millions of people worldwide. This app works by allowing a user to enter their symptoms into seven input boxes, after which the backend compares these symptoms against its dataset and provides a predicted disease. While it is not perfectly accurate due to limited training data, it already demonstrates how early detection can save time and reduce unnecessary visits to doctors. A system like this is useful because it can help users understand their health conditions quickly, guide them to the right type of doctor if needed, or reassure them when the symptoms are minor. If scaled with real AI integration, Dr.REM could one day provide predictions as accurate as ChatGPT or Gemini but in the medical field, accessible even without internet connectivity. This would not only save time and money but also change how people interact with healthcare, offering them knowledge and control over their health before even stepping into a clinic. By combining early diagnosis, cost-saving, and wide accessibility, Dr.REM demonstrates a future where technology can bridge the gap between people and healthcare, ultimately saving lives and reshaping the way we deal with diseases. 

One of the biggest hidden issues in healthcare isn’t just diagnosis  it’s silent emergencies. Imagine someone collapsing at home due to a stroke, seizure, or heart attack, and by the time family notices and calls for help, it’s often too late. Every year, millions of people die not because treatment doesn’t exist, but because no one noticed in time. Current phones and wearables can measure heart rate, oxygen levels, and steps, but they don’t actively monitor for critical warning signs such as abnormal breathing, sudden immobility, or unusual silence from a normally active person. To address this gap, we propose an AI-powered passive health monitor app  envisioned as part of Dr.REM’s future vision  that combines smartphone sensors with optional wearables like smartwatches or earbuds to detect life-threatening emergencies in real time. The microphone could detect irregular breathing patterns such as gasping, choking, or heavy snoring linked to sleep apnea, while the accelerometer and gyroscope would track sudden falls, convulsions, or prolonged immobility, and the camera (optionally with infrared) could provide non-invasive monitoring of chest movements during sleep. An AI behavior model would learn each user’s normal daily activity patterns  like movement, speech, or phone use  and trigger an alert if these suddenly stop for unusual lengths of time, signaling possible unconsciousness. When danger is detected, the app first sends a loud alert for the user to cancel if they are safe; if there’s no response, it automatically notifies family members and the nearest hospital or ambulance service with the user’s GPS location. This approach could be a game-changer, cutting down emergency response times and saving millions of lives, while requiring nothing more than the smartphone most people already own. Beyond being a 24/7 safety net, future versions of Dr.REM could even expand to detect mental health crises, predicting suicidal tendencies or severe depression from unusual inactivity or irregular phone use. While much of the world is focused on AI for disease diagnosis, very few are addressing AI for silent emergencies before it’s too late  and that’s exactly the gap Dr.REM aims to fill.
